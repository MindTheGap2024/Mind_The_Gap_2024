		<h3>Agamben and the Camp as a Biopolitical Paradigm</h3>
	
	<p align="left">Giorgio Agamben frequently identifies the ‘camp’ as a biopolitical paradigm. After</p>
	<p>a brief investigation on the concept of paradigm, this article highlights the importance of the</p>
	<p>camp in Agamben’s ideas, demonstrating that it emblematises the dominance of biopolitical power </p>
	<p>pover life. It is important to explore Agamben’s strategies, both practical and theoretical, as well</p>
	<p>as political and philosophical, if we are to prevent a total dominance of the camp across the globe;</p>
	<p>that is to say, as a place ruled by a permanent state of exception and where only ‘bare life’ can live.</p>
	<p>Through these strategies, Agamben aims to disrupt the way power and life interact.</p>

	<h2>Orla Fitzptrick</h2>
	<h3>“To Restitute to the Inner Life a New Privilege’”. Emmanuel Levinas and the Experience of Captivity</h3>
	
	<p>The aim of my talk is to analyse the relationship between Levinas’s experience of captivity— Levinas</p>
	<p>was captured with the French 10th Army in the Somme region on 18 June 1940 and remained a prisoner until>/p>
	<p>18 April 1945 —and the concept of the ‘inner life’, of which Levinas emphasises the possibility of deepening</p>
	<p>in the camps for prisoner-of-war soldiers, including Jews. This is a fundamental difference from the testimonies</p>
	<p>of deportees to concentration and extermination camps. The reference texts, in addition to the Prison Notebooks,</p>
	<p>will be some of Levinas’ speeches from the first months after his return to France. The theoretical cores on which</p>
	<p>I will focus, developed in direct relation to the experience of imprisonment, are those of precarity, dignity, freedom</p>
	<p>and Jewish identity.
	<p>[1] E. Levinas, Senza nome, in Nomi propri, tr. it. e cura di F.P. Ciglia, Marietti, Casale Monferrato (BO) 1984, p. 158.</p>

		<h3>“Playing to Live”: Music in the Camps</h3>
	
	<p>Abstract: The contribution aims to investigate the role that music played within the concentration</p>
	<p>camp universe, in particular through the singular story of the Auschwitz women’s orchestra. The ambiguous</p>
	<p>position of the musicians, mostly amateurs, who found themselves performing for their own executioners, must</p>
	<p>be understood starting from the unprecedented potential of resistance that music, as well as art in general,</p>
	<p>offered to the prisoners of the camps, allowing them not only to benefit from a less brutal and mortifying</p>
	<p>treatment than the other prisoners, but also opening up to them precious spaces of inner freedom.</p>

	 <h2>Sandro Gorgone</h2>
	 <h3>Without Witness: The Aporia of Auschwitz</h3>
	 <p>The unparalleled events at Auschwitz are a metonymy for absolute evil in twentieth century history.</p>
	 <p> Despite numerous witnesses, 	can we really say that we understand what it entailed?  For Primo Levi</p>
	 <p>, communication is ‘necessary for a human to be human’. Historians, however, have pointed to the limitations</p>
	 <p>of description, remarking that ‘there is no good witness, no exact description in all its parts ‘ (M. Bloch).</p>
	 <p> Philosophy, by contrast, goes further by reflecting on a reality that exceeds the sum of facts: ‘The survivors</p>		<p>describedsomething that could not be witnessed’ (G. Agamben). Auschwitz deprives us of a possibility that seems</p>
	<p> inalienable; that is to say, the capacity to exchange experiences through testimony, as it bears witness</p>
	<p> to that which pertains to the Real (J. Lacan), i.e. the unspeakable, the non-symbolisable and de-subjectification.</p>
	<p> So, to what extent is it possible to understand Auschwitz? Is it not the case that the events of Auschwitz are always</p>	<p>indescribable, to a certain extent? The three impossible but indispensable professions indicated by Freud (teaching, governing,</p>
<p> psychoanalysing) can perhaps be supplemented by a fourth: description.</p>
